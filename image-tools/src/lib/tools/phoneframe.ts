/**
 * A phone frame: a screenshot or a screen recording with its corners rounded
 * and a black border around it, so it reads as a phone.
 *
 * One module for both pages that do this, the image tool at
 * `/tools/phone-frame` and the video tool beside it under `/video`, so the two
 * can never disagree about what a phone looks like. It is pure apart from the
 * painter, and the painter only needs the handful of context methods listed in
 * `FrameContext`, so all of it runs under vitest.
 *
 * The API, in the order a caller uses it:
 *
 *   phoneFrameDefaults(w, h, opts)     { bezel, radius } in px, sized like a phone
 *   phoneFrameLimits(w, h, opts)       { bezelMax, radiusMax } for the sliders
 *   phoneFrame(w, h, settings)         PhoneFrame: output size, screen rect, radii
 *   evenPhoneFrame(w, h, settings)     the same on the grid video needs, for H.264
 *   paintPhoneFrame(ctx, frame, opts)  draws it onto a 2D context
 *   paintPhoneMask(ctx, frame)         white where the phone is, for see-through video
 *
 * Image tool: `phoneFrame`, then `paintPhoneFrame` with `screen` set to the
 * decoded picture and no `outside`, so the corners stay transparent.
 *
 * Video tool: `evenPhoneFrame`, then `paintPhoneFrame` with no `screen` and
 * `outside` set to the background colour, onto a canvas of `frame.width` by
 * `frame.height`. That gives one PNG which is opaque where the border and the
 * corners are and see-through exactly where the video goes. ffmpeg crops the
 * video to `frame.screen`'s size, pads it out to the frame's at
 * `frame.screen.x`, `frame.screen.y` and lays the PNG over it. A see-through
 * video leaves `outside` out and takes its alpha from `paintPhoneMask`.
 * `phoneFrameGraph` in `src/lib/video/edit.ts` builds the filter graph.
 *
 * The screenshot is never scaled. The output is the input plus the border on
 * every side, so every pixel of the screen is the one that was captured, and
 * the border and the radius are in the input's own pixels.

 *
 * An even width and height, which H.264 in yuv420p insists on. The border goes
 * on both sides, so it cannot change whether the total is odd: that is decided
 * by the input alone. So an odd input gives up its last column or its last
 * row, with the border on or off, and `screen.width` or `screen.height` comes
 * back one smaller than the input as the signal to crop. The border stays the
 * same on all four sides, and the output is the cropped screen plus twice the
 * border.
 *
 * The first version kept that pixel and put one extra pixel of border on the
 * right and at the bottom instead. ffmpeg can't place it there. Its crop and
 * pad both round a yuv420p picture down to even without saying so, so a
 * 461 × 1001 recording went in as 460 × 1000 and the frame's 461 × 1001 hole
 * showed the pad's black along its last column and row, read out of a real
 * encode as (15, 15, 15) where the screen should have been. Keeping the pixel
 * would take the whole video through 4:4:4 and back, and even then the kept
 * column would share its colour samples with the black border beside it.
 *
 * And an even border, rounded up by at most 1 px. yuv420p stores colour once
 * per 2 × 2 block, so ffmpeg's pad and overlay both round a position down to
 * an even number without saying so. With a 19 px border the video landed at
 * x = 18 while the painted frame left its hole at 19, and the last column of
 * the screen came out as a 1 px line of the background colour down the right
 * edge and along the bottom. Found by reading pixels out of a real encode.
