 *
 * The cost is worth stating plainly. A filter forces a decode and an encode, so
 * almost everything here is in the seconds-to-minutes range where a conversion
 * is often instant. Two operations escape it, and both are worth having for

 *
 *   trim on a keyframe    copies both streams      instant
 *   remove the sound      copies the picture       instant
 *
 * Everything else re-encodes. `-preset veryfast` and the VP8 settings are

 * every frame BT.601, whatever the file said and whether it said anything, so

 * came out tagged limited over full range pixels: every grey stretched, 176
 * shown as 186, a mean difference of 7.9 levels across the screen in the
 * Chrome that made it. The range is written out beside the rest, and
 * `phoneFrameGraph` holds the pixels in it, so the copy plays back with the
 * recording's own contrast, a mean of 0.04 levels off it in Chrome 131 and
 * 154. The range comes from the stream line, where ffmpeg prints what the
 * container says, not what the decoder decided. The matrix tag written is
 * the recording's own, from one of three places.
 *
 * A tag ffmpeg read off the stream line, matrix, primaries and transfer.
 *
 * A tag only the container declares, which is the one ffmpeg's VP9 decoder
 * throws away, and Chrome's MP4 recordings keep theirs there. `readColourTag`
 * finds it as `declaredColour`. Browsers read it, so without it the framed
 * video would play with a different matrix from the recording.
 *
 * No tag at all, and then none is written, explicitly, so every player reads
 * the output with the same guess it read the recording with and the screen
 * can't change colour between the two. The first version wrote its own guess
 * down instead, and an untagged VP8 WebM that Chrome showed as BT.709 came out
 * tagged BT.601, a red up to 18 levels off in the same browser that had just
 * previewed it. The guess is `untaggedMatrix`, and it is written down only
 * where the output would be guessed differently: a VP9 recording, or one the

/**

 * screen where the frame leaves its hole, and the PNG goes over the top: the
 * border, and in its corners either the background colour or nothing. The PNG
 * is one still, and overlay holds its last frame for as long as the video
 * runs, so it is decoded once rather than once a frame.
 *
 * The pad colour never shows. The hole in the PNG is exactly the cropped
 * screen, so everything the padding adds is under an opaque part of the PNG.
 * That is also why its black is left as ffmpeg's, which is 16 in a full range
 * file: nothing is left for it to be seen through. It did show once, when an
 * odd recording was placed a pixel smaller than its hole, see
 * `evenPhoneFrame`. What the PNG itself holds outside the outline is
 * `phoneOverlayOutside`'s decision, and for see-through corners that matters
 * more than it looks: see there.
 *
 * A see-through result needs one more step, because an overlay can only paint
 * over the picture and never make any of it transparent. With the border off,
 * nothing would round the video's own corners. `alphamerge` takes the alpha
 * channel from the mask instead, which is white over the whole phone.
