/**
 * Pulling still images out of a video.

 * one takes a clip and gives back a pile of images, so it gets its own plan,
 * its own runner and its own panel, the same split `merge.ts` needed for the
 * opposite reason.
 *
 * Pure and tested, like the rest of the planning code, because the arithmetic
 * that decides how many files land in somebody's browser memory is exactly the
 * part worth checking without a browser.
